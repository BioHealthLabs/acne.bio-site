      <h2>What Is Acne.bio?</h2>
      <p>
        Acne.bio is an education-first website about acne and acne treatments. The goal is simple:
        provide calm, evidence-based explanations in plain language – without miracle promises or
        product sponsorships.
      </p>
      <p>
        The internet is full of conflicting advice. Some of it is great, some of it is marketing, and
        some of it is simply wrong. Acne.bio aims to help you ask better questions and understand the
        basics before you spend money or change your treatment.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Who Runs the Site?</h2>
      <p>
        Acne.bio is operated by <strong>ronarn AS</strong>, a small Norwegian company that builds
        privacy-respecting apps and niche information sites in health and wellness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Content is written and edited with a “clinic-style” mindset: cautious, realistic, and clear
        about what we know – and what we still do not know – from current research.
      </p>
      <p class="inline-note">
        Acne.bio does not offer personalised medical care. We encourage all visitors to maintain a
        relationship with their own doctor or dermatologist.
      </p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>How Is Acne.bio Funded?</h2>
      <p>
        Acne.bio itself is affiliate-free. There are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No ads or sponsored product placements on this site.</li>
        <li>No paid “ranking” of treatments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When visitors are ready to look at specific products, we link to our comparison hub
        <a href="https://acneheals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AcneHeals.com</a>.
        That site may use affiliate links to retailers such as Amazon and other networks.
      </p>
      <p>
        If someone buys something there, those retailers may pay a small commission – at no extra cost
        to the buyer. This helps fund the time used to maintain both sites.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Independence and Editorial Policy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Brands do not pay to be mentioned on Acne.bio.</li>
        <li>We do not accept payment to change the wording of educational content.</li>
        <li>We try to reference mainstream dermatology and current evidence whenever possible.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If a topic is controversial or evidence is weak, we will say so openly rather than pretend that
        one simple answer exists.
