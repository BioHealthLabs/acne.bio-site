      <p class="hero-subtitle">
        Acne always has a hormonal component – that’s why it often appears around puberty. But for some
        people, hormonal shifts are the <em>main</em> engine behind repeated flare-ups, especially along
        the jawline, chin and lower cheeks.

        Hormonal acne often overlaps with other causes. A doctor or dermatologist who can examine your
        skin and health history is best placed to confirm what is going on.

      <h2>1. How Hormonal Acne Often Looks</h2>
      <p>
        There is no single “hormonal acne look”, but certain patterns show up frequently:
      </p>
      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <div class="card-ghost">
          <h3>Typical features</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Breakouts clustered around the jawline, chin and lower cheeks.</li>
            <li>Flares that track with menstrual cycles or other hormonal changes.</li>
            <li>Deep, tender bumps that sit under the skin for weeks.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card-ghost">
          <h3>Important caveats</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Location alone can’t diagnose hormone problems.</li>
            <li>Teens and adults can both have hormonally influenced acne.</li>
            <li>Other factors (products, friction, diet, medications) often overlap.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>2. Hormones Involved in Acne</h2>
      <p>
        Androgens (a group of hormones that includes testosterone) play a big role in oil production.
        When androgen levels are high, or when the skin is especially sensitive to them, the sebaceous
        glands can produce more sebum and clog more easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some people, conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or other endocrine disorders
        can shift hormone balance and contribute to persistent acne.
      </p>
      <p class="inline-note">
        If you have irregular periods, unwanted hair growth, sudden weight changes or other symptoms
        alongside acne, it is especially important to talk to a doctor, not just tweak skincare.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>3. What Skincare Can (and Can’t) Do</h2>
      <p>
        Topical products cannot fix underlying hormone imbalances, but they can still help:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Retinoids (like adapalene) help prevent clogged pores and improve texture.</li>
        <li>Benzoyl peroxide targets bacteria and inflammation in active spots.</li>
        <li>Gentle, non-comedogenic moisturisers protect the barrier from all this activity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For many people with hormonally influenced acne, skincare is best seen as
        <strong>support</strong> – it manages breakouts on the surface while medical treatments
        address deeper drivers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>4. When Medical Treatment Becomes Important</h2>
      <p>
        If acne is moderate to severe, keeps returning despite good skincare or clearly tracks with
        hormonal shifts, medical options are often considered. These can include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Oral contraceptives designed to help with acne.</li>
        <li>Anti-androgen medications (in some countries, for certain patients).</li>
        <li>Course-based treatments like oral isotretinoin for severe, scarring acne.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="legal-note">
        Which options are available and appropriate depends heavily on your health history, age,
        pregnancy plans and local guidelines. Only your own doctor or dermatologist can weigh those up
        with you.

        <h2>If you recognise yourself here</h2>
        <p>
          Persistent, painful breakouts that affect self-esteem are not something you have to “just
          live with”. Combining a gentle, consistent routine with good medical advice is usually far
          more effective than endlessly switching products.
