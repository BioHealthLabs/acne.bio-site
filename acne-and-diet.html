        The real picture is more nuanced. Diet <em>can</em> influence acne for some people – but not in the

      <h2>1. What the Research Actually Suggests</h2>
      <p>
        Large, perfectly controlled diet studies in acne are rare. Most evidence comes from smaller
        trials, observational studies and patient reports. Patterns that show up repeatedly:
      </p>

      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <div class="card-ghost">
          <h3>Possible aggravating factors</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>High-glycaemic diets (lots of sugary drinks, sweets, white bread).</li>
            <li>Some types of dairy in some people (especially skim milk in a few studies).</li>
            <li>Very heavy intake of ultra-processed foods overall.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card-ghost">
          <h3>Factors often overhyped</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>One single food item (e.g. “that one slice of pizza”).</li>
            <li>Chocolate on its own, without lots of sugar/fat added.</li>
            <li>Short “detoxes” or juice cleanses promising clear skin in a week.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="inline-note">
        In other words: patterns over time matter more than one snack.

      <h2>2. Glycaemic Load, Insulin and Acne</h2>
      <p>
        Several studies suggest that high-glycaemic diets – those that spike blood sugar and insulin
        repeatedly – may worsen acne in some people. Insulin and related hormones can increase sebum
        production and affect other pathways linked to breakouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        This does <strong>not</strong> mean you need to fear every carbohydrate. It usually means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Base most meals on whole grains, vegetables, protein and healthy fats.</li>
        <li>Keep sugary drinks and sweets as occasional extras, not daily staples.</li>
        <li>Combine carbs with protein/fat to blunt big spikes.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>3. Dairy and Acne – Why the Confusion?</h2>
      <p>
        Some observational studies have found an association between certain dairy products and acne,
        especially skim milk. The reasons are not fully understood and may involve hormones, growth
        factors or processing differences.
      </p>

      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <div class="mini-card">
          <h3>What this might mean</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>If you notice clear flares after lots of milk, a short trial reduction may be reasonable.</li>
            <li>Yogurt and cheese seem less consistently associated than milk in some studies.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="mini-card">
          <h3>What it does <em>not</em> mean</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>That all people with acne must go 100% dairy-free forever.</li>
            <li>That cutting dairy will “cure” acne if other drivers are strong.</li>

      <h2>4. Supplements, Superfoods and Red Flags</h2>
      <p>
        The supplement market around acne is huge. Some ingredients – like zinc or omega-3 fats –
        have limited but interesting data behind them. Others are mostly marketing.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be wary of anything promising a complete “cure” in days or weeks.</li>
        <li>Very high doses of single vitamins (especially vitamin A) can be dangerous.</li>
        <li>Supplements work best as small additions to a solid routine, not magic bullets.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="inline-note">
        Always talk to a doctor or pharmacist before starting supplements, particularly if you take
        other medications or are pregnant/planning pregnancy.

      <h2>5. How to Experiment With Diet Without Losing Your Mind</h2>
      <p>
        If you suspect food plays a role in your acne, you can run a simple, structured experiment
        instead of cutting everything at once:
      </p>
      <ol class="numbered">
        <li><strong>Stabilise your skincare:</strong> keep products consistent for a few weeks.</li>
        <li><strong>Pick one variable:</strong> for example, sugary drinks or milk.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce it for 6–8 weeks:</strong> track breakouts and how you feel.</li>
        <li><strong>Reintroduce slowly:</strong> see if flares return in a clear pattern.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If nothing changes, that specific trigger is likely not a huge factor for you – and you can
        focus more on evidence-based treatments instead of endless food rules.

      <div class="cta-clinic-text">
        <h2>Next step: focus on the basics</h2>
        <p>
          Even when diet plays a role, acne almost never improves on food changes alone.
          A gentle routine, the right actives and, when needed, medical treatment are usually
          what make the biggest visible difference.
