      <h2>1. Types of Acne Scars</h2>
      <p>
        Many people use “scarring” to describe any mark after a breakout. Dermatology separates them
        into a few categories:
      </p>

      <div class="grid grid-3">
        <div class="mini-card">
          <h3>Post-inflammatory erythema</h3>
          <p>
            Flat pink or red marks, common in lighter skin tones. More related to blood vessels than
            true scars. Often fade gradually over months.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mini-card">
          <h3>Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation</h3>
          <p>
            Brown or darker marks after acne, especially in deeper skin tones. Pigment, not holes in
            the skin. Sunscreen is critical here.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mini-card">
          <h3>Indented (“atrophic”) scars</h3>
          <p>
            True texture changes – ice-pick, boxcar, rolling scars. These usually need in-clinic
            procedures to improve significantly.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>2. Preventing New Scars</h2>
      <p>
        The most effective scar strategy is boring but powerful:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Control active acne early:</strong> the fewer deep, inflamed spots you have,
            the fewer chances there are for scars.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not pick:</strong> squeezing and digging increases the likelihood of dents and
            darker marks.</li>
        <li><strong>Use sunscreen daily:</strong> UV exposure makes red and brown marks hang around
            longer and can deepen pigment changes.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>3. What Topical Products Can and Can’t Do</h2>
      <p>
        At-home products can’t “fill in” deep scars, but they can help with colour and overall texture:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Retinoids support collagen over time and smooth minor unevenness.</li>
        <li>Ingredients like azelaic acid and niacinamide can help with red/brown marks.</li>
        <li>Chemical exfoliants (AHA/BHA) refine texture when used carefully.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="inline-note">
        Combine any active routine with a strong barrier focus: gentle cleanser, moisturiser and
        sunscreen every single day.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>4. In-Clinic Options Often Used for Scars</h2>
      <p>
        For true indented scars, professional treatments are usually needed. Common options include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Microneedling:</strong> creates controlled micro-injuries to stimulate collagen.</li>
        <li><strong>Subcision:</strong> uses a needle to break up tethered scar tissue under the skin.</li>
        <li><strong>Laser and light devices:</strong> various types to target texture and redness.</li>
        <li><strong>Chemical peels:</strong> from light peels to deeper, specialist-only options.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="legal-note">
        These procedures carry risks and are not interchangeable. A qualified dermatologist or
        experienced skin doctor should assess which, if any, are appropriate for your skin type and scar
        pattern.

        <h2>Don’t wait for scars to “get bad enough”</h2>
        <p>
          If you are already seeing dents or marks that last longer than a few months, it is worth
          talking to a professional early. Treating acne and protecting your skin now will always be
          easier than reversing years of damage later.
