    <section id="acne-basics" class="card">
      <h2>Acne 101 – What It Is and How It Starts</h2>
      <p>
        Acne forms when a pore (hair follicle) becomes clogged with oil (sebum), dead skin cells and
        sometimes bacteria. The pore swells, becomes inflamed, and shows up on the surface as a
        <strong>whitehead, blackhead or pimple</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hormones, especially androgens, can increase oil production and make breakouts more likely.
        Genetics, certain medications and underlying conditions can also play a role.
      </p>

      <p>
        Understanding what kind of spots you have helps you choose a more targeted treatment.
      </p>

      <div class="grid grid-3">
        <div class="mini-card">
          <h3>Non-inflammatory acne</h3>
          <p>
            Blackheads and whiteheads (comedones). Usually caused by clogged pores without much redness.
            Often respond well to salicylic acid and retinoids.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mini-card">
          <h3>Inflammatory acne</h3>
          <p>
            Red, swollen pimples and papules. Bacteria and inflammation are more involved.
            Benzoyl peroxide and some topical antibiotics can help – under guidance.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mini-card">
          <h3>Cystic/nodular acne</h3>
          <p>
            Deep, painful lumps under the skin. High risk of scarring.
            This usually requires prescription treatment and professional care.

    <section id="ingredients" class="card">
      <h2>Key Acne Ingredients – What They Actually Do</h2>
      <p>
        Many acne products use the same handful of active ingredients. Knowing what each one does helps
        you avoid doubling up or irritating your skin.
      </p>

      <div class="grid grid-3">
        <div class="mini-card">
          <h3>Salicylic acid (BHA)</h3>
          <p>
            Oil-soluble acid that helps unclog pores and smooth texture. Great for blackheads and rough
            areas. Often used in cleansers or leave-on liquids.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mini-card">
          <h3>Benzoyl peroxide</h3>
          <p>
            Targets acne-causing bacteria and inflammation. Very effective, but can be drying and may
            bleach fabrics. Often used as cleanser or leave-on gel.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mini-card">
          <h3>Retinoids (like adapalene)</h3>
          <p>
            Vitamin A derivatives that normalise cell turnover and help prevent clogged pores.
            Often used long-term to keep acne under control.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="inline-note">
        Hydrating ingredients (like glycerin, ceramides and hyaluronic acid) are not “extras” – they are
        essential to keep your barrier intact while you treat acne.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- ROUTINE -->
    <section id="routine" class="card">
      <h2>How to Build a Beginner-Friendly Acne Routine</h2>
      <p>
        Most barrier damage comes from doing too much, too fast. A conservative approach usually works
        better than a full “acne kit” all at once.
      </p>

      <ol class="numbered">
        <li><strong>Cleanse:</strong> use a mild, non-stripping cleanser once or twice per day.</li>
        <li><strong>Treat:</strong> apply one active product (BHA, BPO or adapalene) on dry skin.</li>
        <li><strong>Moisturise:</strong> use a simple, non-comedogenic moisturiser.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect:</strong> daily broad-spectrum SPF 30+ in the morning.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust:</strong> increase frequency slowly as your skin tolerates it.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Very reactive or nervous? Start with treatment every third night, or use a “sandwich method”
        (moisturiser → treatment → moisturiser again).

    <!-- FAQ BLOCK -->
    <section id="faq" class="card faq">
      <h2 class="section-title">Acne FAQ</h2>

      <h3>Can I “dry out” my acne to make it go away faster?</h3>
      <p>
        Over-drying the skin almost always backfires. Your barrier becomes irritated and inflamed, which
        can trigger more breakouts. Aim for calm, slightly hydrated skin – not tight and stripped.
      </p>

      <h3>Does acne mean my skin is dirty?</h3>
      <p>
        No. Many people with acne have very good hygiene and sometimes wash too much. Acne is a medical
        skin condition, not a moral failing or a sign of being “unclean”.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I use makeup if I have acne?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, if you choose non-comedogenic products and remove them gently at the end of the day.
        Heavy, fragranced or very occlusive formulas can make breakouts worse in some people.
